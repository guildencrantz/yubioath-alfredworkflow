# yubioath-alfredworkflow

This workflow uses the [yubioath](https://developers.yubico.com/yubioath-desktop/) cli application to lookup OATH tokens and pass them into the currently selected active window.

Right now this workflow only works if you've executed `yubioath -R` to save your PIN to disk.
